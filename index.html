                <p>Polling companies today use random sampling in an effort to secure accurateness. Unfotunately, they use almost exclusively land-line phones.
				Many people are no longer on that grid. Our sampling will draw from both populations.</p>
				<p>In general, there are 2 types of polls within Asq.Us: (1) <b>Everyone</b>, (2) <b>Random Sample</b>. 
				<p><b>Everyone:</b> These polls may not be as statistically precise as random samples, but they are useful nonetheless.</p>
				<p><b>Random Sample</b>: We use both traditional mechnanisms (land-line phones) and new media within the random sampling. These polls
						are actually <b>more accurate/representative</b> than what is available today.

                <p>This is a risk. Groups can potentially rally their followers and encourage them to vote on some issue. But this is the way politics works. As well, if the representative wants
                to avoid this kind of skewing, s/he can opt for the Random Poll (see above).

                <p>No. A direct democracy is probably neither feasible nor advisable. Nonetheless, constituents should still be represented.

                <p>Many representatives currently spend between 5-10% of their budgets on polling. Our platform is free to use. As well, when a representative gets into office, s/he typically only has a small subset of people on their mailing list, and those tend to be of the same party. AsqUs allows them to reach out to people of any political leaning. We will also be aggressively promoting the platform so they don�t have to do that work. Finally, reaching out to constituents is something they ought to be doing; and with a free platform, they won�t have any excuse.

				<p>On the other hand, to prevent the tyranny of the majority, representatives will also have the ability to review all questions and can
				respond to any, even if those didn't result in being the most popular.

        <p>
        People want to be heard. They want to feel like they matter. But within our current political system, people are frustrated because they feel that just isn't happening.
</p>
<p>
What happened to the notion of representation in democracy? When was the last time your representative (at any level) reached out and asked how you felt about some issue?
</p>
<p>
This rarely happens (unless maybe you've written a large check).
</p>
<p>
Asq.Us was founded to tackle this problem. We are putting representation back into democracy.
</p>
<p>
With modern technology, it can't be that difficult to have a meaningful dialogue between representatives and constituents. Democracy can be made much simpler by allowing our representatives to easily gauge the opinions of their constituents, and vice versa - allowing constituents to ask questions of their representatives.
</p>
<p>
And this should be a public dialogue. We should see how people feel about issues that affect them. And we should see how our representatives act in the face of that.
</p>
<p>
How are we gonna get there? We're certainly not going to leave this to our politicians. We, the people, need to build this platform.
</p>
<p>
Asq.Us is a publicly-owned political dialogue platform, connecting you to your representatives. We are building it and it will be free to use by any qualifed representative. If we build it, they will come.
</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>To create a political dialogue platform that promotes substantive discourse, transparency and accountability.
                </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="pane" id="problem">
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
There is very little, if any, meaningful dialogue between representatives and constituents. People's voices are not heard, and rarely solicited. This leads to disillusionment with the political process and distrust of government.
                </p>
                <p>
Secondly, representatives typically do not have the resources (technical expertise, funding or time) to invest in a sophisticated dialogue platform. Costs associated with current polling options inherently limit usage and voter engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
As well, dialogue driven exclusively from one representative can be seen as ultimately motivated by fundraising desires.
                </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="pane" id="solution">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
Leveraging modern Internet technology and connectivity, we will build a publicly-funded, free-to-use dialogue platform that will allow representatives to quickly poll their constituents regarding issues. Politicians will be able to consult their constituents, in real-time, on as many issues as they deem important.
                </p>
                <p>
We assume that constituents do want to be solicited, on a regular basis, by their representatives, provided the system is simple and meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
The platform will be non-invasive - accessing people where they are - online, facebook, on their phones (smart phones, dumb phones, and land lines), providing better statistical accuracy of the results than current polling methods.
                </p>
                <p>
We are asking people to 'have a voice', to be part of the political dialogue. We are not asking them to support any particular representative or cause. Encouraging people to support democracy generally, while being politically neutral, will lead to more participation.
                </p>
                <p>
The system will be completely granular for constituents, allowing them complete control over their level of engagement, having options to participate on local/regional/state/national levels, as well as how frequently they are solicited and even over what types of issues.
                </p>
                <p>
Polls and their results will be filterable by important demographic variables (gender, age, region, etc.) - any variable that the participant wants to expose.
                </p>
                <p>
To guarantee the integrity of the system, it will not be a commercial venture, but will be run by a non-profit and owned by the constituents themselves. We, the people, will offer the system to our representatives and expect them to use it. That is what a democracy is. We expect to be represented.
                </p>
                <p>
Results will be publicly viewable. Votes are tallied anonymously, but you will be able to see how you voted (which is private), how others voted as a group, and ultimately, what your representative did in the face of how the public felt (how s/he voted or did/not support some issue).
                </p>
                <p>
We will also be able to see how frequently a representative leveraged the platform, which will further encourage them to use the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
Each issue will be supported by a more in-depth discussion of the issue, involving a summary, the results of polling, community-weighted conversation/comments and official positions of the relevant representatives.
                </p>
                <p>
This deeper discussion can be accessed easily, from links within each initial poll.
                </p>
                <p>
Within a short time, we will have a modern platform for enriched political dialogue.

                <h3>Funding/Resources</h3>
                <p>
Within a short time (~3 years), we expect to be fully funded by the constituents themselves. The platform will be a valuable public resource, similar to Wikipedia, that people will be happy to support with small contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
Before we can get to that level of grass-roots support, we are soliciting grants and donations.
                </p>
                <p>
We anticipate maintaining the platform with a small amount of full-time employees. We also expect larger participation by the open-source community that want to work on meaningful solutions for a better world.
